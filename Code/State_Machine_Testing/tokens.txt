String_Input: Here's a random string, made in python, something entered, proteus words, JPL vs NASA, this code is very buggy, Now you need to impliment events, learn about event syntax, Do stuff with events, Events and stuff doing things, actors acting and whatnot, states are stated, There's issues with infinite loops in here, Please help me, im trapped in here!, Debug this code for a prize, I wonder if this string changed value, More sentences!, This was easier in Python than C++, I don't care if Python is 'easier', I prefer C++
